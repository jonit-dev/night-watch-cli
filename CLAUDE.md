# Critical
- Favor composition over inheritance, use tsyringe
- Favor SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID principles.

# General Instructions

- Use yarn as package manager
- Always yarn verify and run related tests after code changes
- Favor `@/*` path aliases over relative imports — use `@/utils/foo.js` instead of `../../utils/foo.js`; single-level `./` imports are fine
